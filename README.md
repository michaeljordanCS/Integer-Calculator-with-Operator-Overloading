#  Integer Calculator with Operator Overloading
As stated this assignment I was tasked with creating a Simple calculator application. 
I had to implemment operator overloading to achieve my desired outcome for this calculator.
I constructed this code based on the slide from class that explaned operator overloading and how to code them.
I always made three files one for the defining of data members/functions for Integer and another for implementation,  with the third being main.cpp.
